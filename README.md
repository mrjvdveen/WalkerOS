# WalkerOS
Walker OS is an OS built in javascript, running in a browser. It is a toy first and formost.

The aim is to build a game of sorts, where you need to program and maybe hack your way through in order to unravel a mistery.
It will include:
- A programming language called Walk
- A parser and interpreter for the Walk language
- A console
- A filesystem / storage system
- Security built in to the OS
- Some sort of network simulation
- Some sort of e-mail simulation
- Some sort of IoT simulation
